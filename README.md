  Gatsby Tutorial
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Credit

This project is based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hw1g77I35ZivVLe8k2nvjB) from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) channel on YouTube. 

## Why Gatsby?

1. I've wanted to learn Gatsby so that I have a framework in my toolkit that is known for being faster and has a better reputation for SEO. 
2. I found a [code walk through tool](https://github.com/walkthru/walkthru) that is based on React. I wanted to test the implementation of it, but I needed to learn either Next.js or Gatsby first. I could have used simple React, but this gave me an opportunity to dig into Gatsby. Now that I have Gatsby down, I can look at this walk through.
